//Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

//Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

//With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.


// create a variable named kelvin, and set it equal to 293
let kelvin = 293;

//define variable celsius
let celsius = kelvin - 293;

// define variable fahrenheit
let fahrenheit = celsius * (9/5) + 32;

// use math.floor method to round the decimal
let temperature = Math.floor(fahrenheit);

//the program prints the value of temp entered in kelvin above in fahrenheit.
console.log(`The temperature is ${temperature} degrees Fahrenheit.`);

// Temperature in Newton

let newton = celsius * (33/100);

let temperature_in_newton = Math.floor(newton);

//the program prints the value of temp entered in kelvin above in fahrenheit.
console.log(`The temperature is ${temperature_in_newton} degrees Newton.`);
