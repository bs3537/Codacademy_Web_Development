//Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. 
//We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 
//In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. 
//How old would you be if you were a dog?

// Set my age variable
let myAge = 36;

// set variable early years 
let earlyYears = 2;

// reassign variable earlyYears using multiplication assignment operator 
earlyYears = earlyYears *= 10.5;

//set laterYears variable
let laterYears = myAge -=2;

// use division assigment operator
laterYears = laterYears /=4;

// set my age in dog years variable

let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears += laterYears

//write your name as string and convert to lower case

let myName = 'Bob';
myName = myName.toLowerCase();

//use string interpolation method to print your age in dog years
console.log (`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
